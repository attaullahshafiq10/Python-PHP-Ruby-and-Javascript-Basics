# Python, PHP, Ruby and Javascript Basics

### Getting Started
Below we will have the patterns for all the main programming concepts in four different languages. To try them out head over the website, repl.it and create a free environment to practice in these languages.

We will follow the process you should always follow when learning a new language:
1. Learn how to print values to the console
2. Learn how to assign variables
3. Conditionals
4. Loops
5. Collections
6. Functions


After these building blocks, you'll be able to begin pushing yourself further and do challenges on websites


### Printing Values to the Console
You will generally interact with a programming language via your command line shell (Bash on mac/linux, cmd/powershell/gitBash on windows). So once you have any of these languages on your computer you'll write files and run them with a command. We can't see what our code is doing visually beyond occasionally printing values to the console to assure us the program is following our instructions.
